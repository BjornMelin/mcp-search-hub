## MVP Status: Final Tasks in Progress

Most high-priority tasks for the initial MVP release have been completed. We still need to address the following to finalize the MVP:

### 1. Code Quality Improvements (Critical for MVP) ⭐⭐⭐

- [ ] Apply consistent architectural patterns across all modules
  - [x] Review provider modules for pattern consistency
    - [x] Standardize retry logic in provider modules
    - [x] Document architectural patterns in consistent-architectural-patterns.md
  - [ ] Ensure uniform error handling approaches
  - [ ] Standardize configuration loading patterns
  - [ ] Align initialization sequences across components
  
- [x] Ensure proper use of Pydantic 2.0 across the codebase
  - [x] Audit all model definitions for Pydantic 2.0 compatibility
  - [x] Update validation patterns to use Pydantic 2.0 features
  - [x] Standardize model configuration and field definitions
  - [x] Review serialization/deserialization patterns
  
- [x] Standardize error handling and exception patterns
  - [x] Create custom exception hierarchy in utils/errors.py
  - [x] Implement consistent error propagation in providers
  - [x] Add comprehensive error documentation in README
  - [x] Update middleware to handle all error types appropriately
    - [x] Update auth.py to use AuthenticationError
    - [x] Fix middleware tests to handle bearer token authentication
    - [x] Document middleware error handling patterns
  
- [x] Implement consistent service interfaces for all components
  - [x] Standardize provider interface methods
  - [x] Create consistent router component interfaces
  - [x] Ensure result processing components share common interfaces
  - [x] Document interface contracts clearly

### 2. Documentation Enhancements (Required for MVP) ⭐⭐

- [ ] Improve documentation with type hints and docstrings
  - [ ] Add type hints to all public functions and methods
  - [ ] Create comprehensive docstrings with parameter descriptions
  - [ ] Document return types for all functions
  - [ ] Add usage examples in docstrings for complex functions
  
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
  - [ ] Document provider integration architecture decisions
  - [ ] Create ADR for routing system design
  - [ ] Document caching implementation decisions
  - [ ] Explain middleware architecture choices
  - [ ] Record provider selection strategy decisions

## Completed MVP Features

The project already includes the following production-ready features:

- Unified provider implementation with GenericMCPProvider
- Simplified routing system with UnifiedRouter
- Middleware architecture for cross-cutting concerns
- OpenAPI documentation and SDK generation
- Enhanced result processing with deduplication
- Tiered caching system with Redis support
- Provider management with rate limiting and budget tracking
- Comprehensive testing suite
- ML-enhanced query routing
- Docker configuration with multi-stage builds and deployment guides
- Custom exception hierarchy for standardized error handling
