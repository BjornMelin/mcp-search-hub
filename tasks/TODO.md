  - [ ] Review provider modules for pattern consistency
  - [ ] Ensure uniform error handling approaches
  - [ ] Standardize configuration loading patterns
  - [ ] Align initialization sequences across components
  
- [ ] Standardize error handling and exception patterns
  - [ ] Create custom exception hierarchy in utils/errors.py
  - [ ] Implement consistent error propagation in providers
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error documentation in README
  - [ ] Update middleware to handle all error types appropriately
  
- [ ] Implement consistent service interfaces for all components
  - [ ] Standardize provider interface methods
  - [ ] Create consistent router component interfaces
  - [ ] Ensure result processing components share common interfaces
  - [ ] Document interface contracts clearly

### 2. Documentation Enhancements (Required for MVP) ⭐⭐

- [ ] Improve documentation with type hints and docstrings
  - [ ] Add type hints to all public functions and methods
  - [ ] Create comprehensive docstrings with parameter descriptions
  - [ ] Document return types for all functions

  - [ ] Document provider integration architecture decisions
  - [ ] Create ADR for routing system design
  - [ ] Document caching implementation decisions
  - [ ] Explain middleware architecture choices
  - [ ] Record provider selection strategy decisions

## Completed MVP Features

The project already includes the following production-ready features:

- Unified provider implementation with GenericMCPProvider
- Simplified routing system with UnifiedRouter
- Middleware architecture for cross-cutting concerns
- OpenAPI documentation and SDK generation
- Enhanced result processing with deduplication
- Tiered caching system with Redis support
- Provider management with rate limiting and budget tracking
- Comprehensive testing suite
- ML-enhanced query routing
- Docker configuration with multi-stage builds and deployment guides
