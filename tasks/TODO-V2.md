# MCP Search Hub - Future Enhancements (v2.0)

Last updated: May 25, 2025

## V2.0 Enhancements

### Production Deployment Enhancements

#### 1. Advanced Logging and Observability ⭐⭐

- [ ] Add logging and observability
  - [ ] Implement structured logging
  - [ ] Add request tracing with correlation IDs
  - [ ] Create error reporting system
  - [ ] Set up monitoring hooks

#### 2. Additional Deployment Options ⭐⭐

- [ ] Support additional deployment options
  - [ ] Create Kubernetes configuration
  - [ ] Add serverless deployment support
  - [ ] Document hosting provider options

### Performance Optimization ⭐

- [ ] Conduct performance profiling and optimize bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement async context manager pattern consistently
- [ ] Optimize parallel execution with more efficient task management
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint of large response payloads
- [ ] Implement streaming response option for large result sets

## Implementation Planning

### Immediate Focus (v2.0 Priority)

- Implement structured logging and request tracing
- Create Kubernetes configuration

### Secondary Focus (v2.0)

- Support additional deployment options (Kubernetes, serverless)
- Conduct performance profiling and optimize bottlenecks

### Future Considerations (v2.1+)

- Streaming response option for large result sets
- Advanced monitoring and observability integrations

### Resource Allocation Suggestion

For the v2.0 tasks, we recommend:

- 1 developer focused on Deployment & Operations
- 1 developer (with performance expertise) for Performance Optimization tasks

This parallel approach will allow for faster completion while maintaining focus in each area.

> Note: Code Organization and Standards tasks have been moved to the MVP scope in the main TODO.md file.
