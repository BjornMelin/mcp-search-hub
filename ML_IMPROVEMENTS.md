# ML Improvements in MCP Search Hub

This document outlines the ML enhancements implemented in the Search Hub to improve performance, flexibility, and capabilities.

## 1. Embedding Generation Optimizations

### 1.1 Performance Enhancements

#### Hardware Acceleration
- **Multi-backend support**: Added support for ONNX and OpenVINO backends (2-3x speedup)
- **GPU optimization**: Automatic detection of CUDA capabilities with FP16/BF16 precision
- **Model quantization**: Reduces model size and improves inference speed (up to 4x)
- **Tensor Core detection**: Automatic BF16 for Ampere+ GPUs, FP16 for others

#### Caching System
- **Tiered caching**: Combined memory (LRU) and disk-based caching
- **Persistent embeddings**: Disk cache persists between application restarts
- **Optimized cache lookups**: Fast hash-based retrieval

#### Batch Processing
- **Parallel processing**: Multi-process embedding generation for large batches
- **Optimized batching**: Dynamic batch sizing based on GPU memory/CPU cores
- **Normalized embeddings**: Pre-normalized for faster similarity calculations

### 1.2 Usage Improvements

- **Lazy loading**: Models only load when first used, reducing startup time
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when ML features aren't available
- **Enhanced similarity**: Optimized single and batch similarity calculations

## 2. Model Training and Updating

### 2.1 Fine-tuning Capabilities

- **Custom model training**: Fine-tune models on domain-specific data
- **Multiple training modes**: Support for regression and classification tasks
- **Evaluation metrics**: Built-in model evaluation with correlation metrics

### 2.2 Model Export

- **ONNX export**: Export trained models to ONNX for faster inference
- **OpenVINO support**: Convert to OpenVINO IR for edge deployment
- **Quantization**: Post-training quantization for resource-constrained environments

### 2.3 Training Data Management

- **Training example creation**: Helpers for creating training data from queries
- **Dataset splitting**: Automatic train/validation splits
- **Mixed training data**: Support for similarity scores and binary pairs

## 3. A/B Testing Framework

- **Experiment variants**: Test different model configurations with controlled traffic
- **Assignment strategies**: Random, deterministic, or user-based assignment
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor metrics across variant groups
- **Shadow testing**: Run experiments without affecting user experience

## 4. Implementation Examples

The repository includes example scripts for:

1. **ML Optimizations Demo**: Benchmark different optimization combinations
2. **Model Training**: Complete example of fine-tuning custom models
3. **A/B Testing**: Demonstrate how to set up A/B tests for search optimization

## 5. Installation and Dependencies
