# MCP Search Hub TODO List

Last updated: May 21, 2025

## Current Priorities

### High Priority (Essential for Production)

#### 1. Deployment & Operations ⭐⭐

- [ ] Update Docker configuration
  - [ ] Use multi-stage build for smaller images
  - [ ] Add proper health checks to Docker configuration
  - [ ] Create Docker Compose development and production setups
  - [ ] Configure proper environment variable handling
- [ ] Add logging and observability
  - [ ] Implement structured logging
  - [ ] Add request tracing with correlation IDs
  - [ ] Create error reporting system
  - [ ] Set up monitoring hooks
- [ ] Support additional deployment options
  - [ ] Create Kubernetes configuration
  - [ ] Add serverless deployment support
  - [ ] Document hosting provider options

### Medium Priority (Enhances Quality and Maintainability)

#### 2. Code Organization and Standards ⭐⭐

- [ ] Apply consistent architectural patterns across all modules
- [ ] Standardize error handling and exception patterns
- [ ] Implement consistent service interfaces for all components
- [ ] Improve documentation with type hints and docstrings
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for design choices

#### 3. Performance Optimization ⭐

- [ ] Conduct performance profiling and optimize bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement async context manager pattern consistently
- [ ] Optimize parallel execution with more efficient task management
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint of large response payloads
- [ ] Implement streaming response option for large result sets

## Analysis of Remaining Tasks

### Progress Assessment

The project has made excellent progress with 9 major features/refactorings completed:
- Provider Implementation Consolidation (May 16)
- Routing System Simplification (May 16)
- Middleware Architecture Implementation (May 22)
- Automated OpenAPI Documentation (May 21)
- Result Processing Improvements (May 20)
- Caching System Enhancement (May 22)
- Provider Management Enhancements (May 22)
- Testing and Quality Improvements (May 23)
- ML-Enhanced Features including LLM-directed routing (May 21)

The remaining tasks focus on three key areas:
1. **Deployment & Operations**: Essential for production readiness
2. **Code Organization and Standards**: Enhances long-term maintainability
3. **Performance Optimization**: Improves user experience and reduces costs

### Recommendation for Task Execution

#### Immediate Focus (Next 1-2 weeks)
- Complete Docker configuration updates for production deployment
- Implement structured logging and request tracing
- Standardize error handling patterns across the codebase

#### Secondary Focus (Next 2-4 weeks)
- Support additional deployment options (Kubernetes, serverless)
- Apply consistent architectural patterns
- Conduct performance profiling and optimize bottlenecks

#### Future Considerations
- Streaming response option for large result sets
- Advanced monitoring and observability integrations
- Architecture decision records for design choices

### Resource Allocation Suggestion

For the remaining tasks, we recommend:
- 1 developer focused on Deployment & Operations
- 1 developer focused on Code Organization and Standards
- 1 developer (with performance expertise) for Performance Optimization tasks

This parallel approach will allow for faster completion while maintaining focus in each area.
